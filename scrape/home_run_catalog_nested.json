Use grey (T03) for dark/medium colored tiles or when cost is primary concern. Both have identical water resistance and bonding strength—the difference is aesthetic. For premium backsplash or visible glass tile installations, white is worth the ₹87 price difference.\nQ2: Is Roff T04 VFA White suitable for bathrooms in Bangalore?\nA:\nYes, absolutely. Bangalore bathrooms experience 80-95% humidity, especially after showers. Roff T04 VFA White's polymer-modified composition maintains adhesive integrity in high moisture. Extend drying time by 8-12 hours during monsoon season (June-September). Ensure proper ventilation to accelerate curing.\nQ3: How much white adhesive do I need for my kitchen backsplash?\nA:\nKitchen backsplash typically covers 5-15 sq meters. With 5-6 sq meter coverage per 20kg bag, a typical 10 sqm backsplash needs 1.7-2 bags. For precise calculation: (Project area ÷ 5.5 sq meters coverage) × 20kg per bag. Add 10% extra for waste. Example: 10 sq meters ÷ 5.5 = 1.82 bags, round up to 2 bags (40kg total).\nQ4: Can I use T04 White on large format tiles (600mm+)?\nA:\nRoff T04 VFA White works for standard size tiles up to 300-400mm. For large format tiles (600mm+), Roff recommends Roff T20 Extrofix Ultra which offers superior bond strength, extended open time (2 hours), and flexibility needed for large tiles. Large tiles' weight demands T20's premium performance.\nQ5: How long before I can grout after applying Roff T04 VFA White?\nA:\nMinimum 24 hours in summer (March-May), 36 hours in monsoon (June-September). In Bangalore's humid climate, extending to 48 hours is safer, especially in monsoon. Touch-test: adhesive should not dent with thumb pressure. Never grout until adhesive fully sets.\nQ6: What's the shelf life of Roff T04 VFA White powder?\nA:\nUnopened bags: 12 months in cool, dry storage. Opened bags: use within 2-3 weeks if stored in sealed bags. Bangalore's high humidity can cause powder to absorb moisture, affecting mixing quality. Store in well-ventilated, moisture-controlled area. Never store in bathrooms or damp areas.\nQ7: Is Roff T04 VFA White better than MYK Laticrete for white tile applications?\nA:\nBoth are quality products. Roff T04 VFA White is locally established with proven Bangalore performance and 24-hour HomeRun delivery. Choice depends on availability and preference. For light-colored tiles specifically, white formulation ensures no shadow marks regardless of brand.\nQ8: Can I mix Roff T04 VFA White with other adhesives?\nA:\nNo. Never mix different adhesive brands or types. Each formula has unique polymer composition and curing properties. Mixing can compromise bond strength and durability. If you need to switch adhesives mid-project, allow first adhesive to fully cure (48 hours), then prepare surface before applying new adhesive.\nQ9: Does Roff T04 VFA White contain harmful chemicals or VOCs?\nA:\nRoff T04 VFA White is low VOC (volatile organic compounds) formulated, making it safer for indoor bathroom and kitchen applications. It's free from heavy metals and contains no asbestos. Suitable for residential and commercial applications. Ensure proper ventilation during mixing and application as good practice.\nQ10: What's the cost-benefit of Roff T04 VFA White at ₹672 vs T03 VFA Grey at ₹585?\nA:\nThe ₹87 per bag premium for white adhesive is worth it for visible installations (kitchen backsplash, bathroom walls with light tiles, glass tile features). For non-visible areas or dark tiles, grey is sufficient. For a 20-bag project, the premium is ₹1,740 total—minimal cost for professional appearance on premium tile investments.\nReturns & Exchange Policy\nReturn Within 24 Hours of delivery under the following conditions:\nDamaged or defective product.\nWrong or missing product.\nProduct cannot be returned once used.\nRefer to Refund Policy for details.",

The white color prevents visibility of the adhesive through semi-translucent stones.\n2. Glass Tile & Mosaic Applications:\nPerfect for decorative glass tiles, glass mosaic, and glass block installations where the white adhesive ensures a clean, professional appearance without color bleeding through.\n3. Large Format Ceramic & Vitrified Tiles:\nIdeal for 60cm×60cm tiles, 80cm×80cm slabs, and larger ceramic or porcelain tiles on both walls and floors. The extended open time accommodates larger surface areas without adhesive skinning over.\n4. Slim Panel & Cladding Systems:\nT20 provides excellent performance with lightweight cladding panels and thin stone veneers, handling the stresses of weight and movement without premature failure.\n5. External Facades & Commercial Projects:\nEngineered for outdoor use, including balconies, terraces, external cladding, and commercial flooring where durability under sun exposure and temperature fluctuations is essential.\n6. Tile-on-Tile Applications:\nWhen installing new tiles over existing tile surfaces (common in renovations), T20's strong polymer-modified bond ensures adhesion to non-porous substrates.\nBangalore Climate Performance\nIn Bangalore's warm, humid climate, T20 performs exceptionally well:\nMonsoon Season (June-September):\nHigher humidity (70-90%) requires 24-36 hours full curing time. Allow extended drying between grouting and water exposure.\nSummer Performance:\nFast surface drying in heat (March-May) makes T20 ideal, but ensure substrate is not overly porous to prevent moisture loss. Water the substrate lightly before application.\nHumidity Management:\nWhite adhesive's water-resistant polymer modification prevents moisture penetration and mold growth in bathrooms and kitchens typical of Bangalore homes.\nTemperature Stability:\nPolymer flexibility accommodates Bangalore's daily temperature variations (15-35°C), preventing adhesive cracking.\nTechnical Specifications\nSpecification\nDetail\nProduct Type\nPolymer-Modified, Cement-Based Tile Adhesive\nClassification\nType C2TE (High flexibility, Extended open time)\nAppearance\nWhite powder\nPackaging\n20 kg paper bag with moisture barrier\nCoverage (3mm bed)\n5-6 m² per 20kg bag (using 6mm × 6mm notch trowel)\nMixing Ratio\nApproximately 1 part adhesive to 0.25-0.30 parts water (adjust for consistency)\nOpen Time\n30-40 minutes at 25°C (longer in cooler conditions, shorter in heat)\nSet Time\n24 hours (standard conditions); 24-36 hours in humid/monsoon conditions\nFull Cure Time\n7 days before grouting or water exposure\nBond Strength\n≥ 1.0 MPa on tile to substrate (exceeds IS 15258 standards)\nWater Resistance\nExcellent; suitable for wet areas, swimming pools, fountains\nFlexibility\nHigh; accommodates substrate movement and thermal cycling\nSuitable Substrates\nCement screeds, concrete, plaster, existing tiles, stone, gypsum boards\nTemperature Range\nApplication: 5-35°C; Storage: 5-40°C (protect from freezing)\nShelf Life\n12 months in sealed, dry conditions\nIS Standard Compliance\nIS 15258:2019 (Type C2TE)\nTile & Material Compatibility\nCeramics:\nAll ceramic tile types (glazed, unglazed, semi-vitrified)\nVitrified Tiles:\nFully vitrified, porcelain, and high-strength tiles (low porosity)\nNatural Stones:\nMarble, limestone, granite, travertine, slate, sandstone\nGlass Tiles & Mosaics:\nDecorative glass, glass block, frosted glass (white adhesive prevents discoloration)\nLarge Slabs:\nThin stone veneers, thin porcelain slabs, and ultra-large format tiles\nSpecialty Materials:\nTerracotta, quarry tiles, pavers, precast terrazzo\nWhy Choose White Over Grey Adhesive\nFeature\nWhite Adhesive (T20)\nGrey Adhesive (T03/T07)\nVisibility Through Tiles\nInvisible behind light/transparent tiles\nVisible as dark shadow marks; creates visual defects\nMarble Applications\nPerfect; no discoloration of light stone\nCan stain light marble with greyish hues\nGlass Tiles\nProfessional appearance; clean finish\nVisible as dark lines; unprofessional look\nLight-Colored Tiles\nMatches aesthetic; blends seamlessly\nCreates visible grid pattern; reduces appeal\nPremium Projects\nEssential for high-end residential & commercial\nNot recommended; compromises finish\nCost Difference\n₹87 premium over grey (worth the investment)\nBudget-friendly but sacrifices appearance\nVersatility\nBest for decorative, aesthetic-focused work\nBetter for standard commercial/industrial\nProfessional Application Tips\nSurface Preparation:\nClean substrate thoroughly; remove dust, loose plaster, grease, and algae\nEnsure substrate is structurally sound and not excessively porous\nFor porous surfaces (plaster, concrete), dampen lightly before application to prevent premature water loss\nExisting tiles must be mechanically roughened or primed for optimal adhesion\nMixing:\nMix 1 kg adhesive with 250-300 ml water using a drill mixer for 2-3 minutes\nAllow 5 minutes slaking time, then remix briefly before application\nAchieve a thick, creamy consistency that spreads without sagging on vertical surfaces\nPrepare only the amount you can use within 30-40 minutes (open time)\nTrowel Application:\nUse 6mm × 6mm notch trowel for large format tiles (60cm and above)\nApply toothed side at 45° angle for consistent ridging and full coverage\nAim for 80-90% coverage on tile back; achieve 100% coverage on substrate\nReplace trowel lines with a new application if adhesive begins to skin over\nTile Placement:\nPress firmly and twist tiles to set them in place; don't slide tiles on adhesive (breaks bond)\nUse spacers (2-3mm) to maintain uniform joint widths for professional appearance\nCheck alignment frequently with a level; T20's extended open time allows corrections within 30-40 minutes\nFor heavy marble/stone, use additional support (props, boards) to prevent tile slippage\nCuring Timeline (Bangalore Climate Adjusted)\nStage\nStandard Conditions\nBangalore Monsoon\nBangalore Summer\nInitial Set\n6-8 hours\n8-12 hours\n4-6 hours\nSurface Walkable\n24 hours\n30-36 hours\n20-24 hours\nGrouting Ready\n48 hours\n72 hours (wait for humidity to drop)\n48 hours\nWater/Moisture Exposure\n7 days\n10-14 days (high humidity extends cure)\n7 days\nFull Strength\n14 days\n21 days (in high humidity)\n14 days\nNote:\nMonsoon humidity (70-90%) significantly extends curing time.

When should I use T20 instead of standard grey adhesives like T03?\nUse T20 for any visible light-colored tiles (white, cream, beige, light grey) or transparent materials (glass, marble). The white color prevents shadow marks and discoloration that compromise aesthetic appeal. T20 is also superior for large format tiles due to extended open time and flexibility. For standard grey ceramic tiles in utility areas, T03 is more economical.\n2. What's the difference between T20 Extrofix Ultra and T04 Vitro Fix?\nT20 (Extrofix Ultra):\nHigh polymer-modified, extended open time (30-40 mins), best for large format tiles, marble, natural stones, outdoor use, and demanding applications. Price: ₹1,265/bag.\nT04 (Vitro Fix):\nLow POC formula, best for small-to-medium glass tiles, vitrified tiles, light internal use. Shorter open time. Price: ₹672/bag. Choose T04 for budget-conscious glass tile projects; T20 for premium marble, outdoor, or large slab installations.\n3. Can I use T20 for tile-on-tile applications?\nYes. T20's polymer-modified formula has excellent adhesion to non-porous tile surfaces. Ensure existing tiles are clean and mechanically roughened (use sandpaper or wire brush). This is common during bathroom/kitchen renovations in Bangalore homes.\n4. How does humidity affect T20 curing in Bangalore?\nHigh humidity (70-90% during monsoon) significantly extends curing times. Plan for 30-36 hours initial set instead of 6-8 hours. Wait 72 hours before grouting. Ensure good ventilation and avoid exposing tiles to water for 10-14 days during monsoon. Polymer modification helps resist moisture infiltration, but full strength requires adequate drying time.\n5. What coverage should I expect from a 20kg bag?\nApproximately 5-6 m² at 3mm bed thickness using a 6mm × 6mm notch trowel. Large format tiles (60cm+) and marble slabs may require slightly thicker beds (3.5-4mm), reducing coverage to 4-5 m². Always account for substrate irregularities and tile size variations.\n6. Is T20 suitable for swimming pools and water features?\nYes. T20's water-resistant polymer modification makes it excellent for pools, fountains, saunas, and spas. However, for specialized pool applications, consider dedicated pool adhesives or epoxy-based options for even greater chemical resistance. T20 is suitable for standard residential pool tiling.\n7. Can I use T20 on exterior balconies and terraces in Bangalore?\nAbsolutely. T20 Extrofix Ultra is specifically engineered for external cladding, balconies, and terraces. Its flexibility accommodates thermal expansion/contraction from Bangalore's temperature variations (15-35°C). The white color is also aesthetically superior for exterior applications. Ensure proper substrate preparation and curing time before exposing to monsoon rains.\n8. What's the water-to-adhesive mixing ratio?\nApproximately 1:0.25-0.30 (1kg adhesive to 250-300ml water). Adjust based on desired consistency—thicker for vertical surfaces, slightly thinner for floors. Mix thoroughly for 2-3 minutes. Allow 5-minute slaking time, then remix briefly. Avoid adding water to an already-mixed batch; remix instead.\n9. How do I prevent tiles from slipping on vertical surfaces with T20?\nT20's non-skid properties help, but proper application is key: Apply thick ridges with the notched trowel, press firmly, and consider using support props for heavy marble/stone tiles. Allow adhesive to partially set (2-3 hours) before installing heavy tiles. Don't slide tiles on the adhesive—press and twist to set. Using slightly thicker adhesive consistency helps on vertical surfaces.\n10. What grout should I pair with T20 adhesive?\nRoff offers compatible white grouts (Roff Epoxy Grout, Roff Cement-Based Grout in white). For marble and light tiles, white grout complements the aesthetic. For glass tiles, epoxy grout provides superior water resistance. Wait 48-72 hours before grouting (depending on humidity) to ensure adhesive has adequate set strength.\n11. Why is T20 more expensive than other adhesives?\nThe ₹87 premium over T03 reflects superior engineering: higher polymer modification, extended open time, reduced slip on vertical surfaces, and enhanced flexibility for large format tiles. In premium projects (marble cladding, glass installations), T20's guaranteed professional finish justifies the cost difference. The extended workability also reduces installation errors and rework, offsetting the premium through labor efficiency.\n12. Is T20 available in grey for aesthetic preference?\nT20 Extrofix Ultra is formulated in white to leverage the premium aesthetic advantages. For large format tiles in grey, consider Roff T07 Extrofix (grey version) or T03 VFA (grey). However, grey is not recommended for marble, glass, or light tiles due to visible shadow marks. White is the superior choice for premium applications.\nReturns & Exchange Policy\nReturn Within 24 Hours of delivery under the following conditions:\nDamaged or defective product.\nWrong or missing product.\nProduct cannot be returned once used.\nRefer to Refund Policy for details.\nElectric Delivery Fleet\nNo Min Order Quantity\nSecure Checkout\nQuality Assurance\nSuperfast delivery in 60 minutes\nDelivery in Minutes\nLow Prices\nPay on Delivery\nNo Minimum Order\nRated 4.9 on Google\nDelivering every Order, reliably.\nSubmit\nLogin",

If your current doors have 35mm concealed hinge holes, these Onsys hinges are direct replacements. For new installations, you'll need to drill 35mm holes at 11.5mm depth.\nWhat's the difference between Onsys and more expensive Hettich hinges?\nOnsys offers the same soft-close technology as premium ranges but with Level 2 European certification vs Level 3. Perfect for residential use with 10-year warranty at a more affordable price point.\nWill these work in my humid bathroom or kitchen?\nAbsolutely! The nickel-plated steel finish passes 120-hour salt spray corrosion testing. They're designed for Indian climate conditions and work reliably in humid environments.\nHow do I know which crank angle I need?\nMeasure how your door should sit relative to the cabinet frame. Full overlay (0 crank) is most common, covering the entire frame. Half overlay (8 crank) shows part of the frame, and inset (16 crank) sits flush inside the opening.\nCan I adjust the doors after installation?\nYes! Onsys hinges feature 3-dimensional adjustment: overlay (+2/-2mm), depth (+2.5/-1.5mm), and height adjustment at the mounting plate. Perfect alignment is always achievable.\nReturns & Exchange Policy\nReturn within 24 hours of delivery under the following conditions:\nDamaged or defective product\nWrong or missing product\nProduct cannot be returned once used\nRefer to Refund Policy for complete details",

As part of Hettich's premium KA series, this telescopic channel combines precision ball bearing technology with the innovative\nSilent System\nfor virtually silent drawer operation.\nSilent System Technology - The Heart of Quiet Operation\nThe integrated\nSilent System soft-close mechanism\nis what sets the KA 4532 apart from standard drawer channels. When you push a drawer closed, the Silent System gently catches it and pulls it into the fully closed position with cushioned, controlled motion. This eliminates slamming, reduces noise pollution in your home or office, and significantly extends the life of both the drawer and its contents.\nPremium Ball Bearing Construction\nUnlike cheaper roller-based systems, the KA 4532 uses\nhardened steel ball bearings\nenclosed in noise-absorbing plastic cages. This precision engineering delivers:\nSmooth, effortless operation\neven under full 35kg load\nYears of maintenance-free service\n- Hettich guarantees 10 years\nHigh lateral stability\npreventing drawer wobble or tilting\nQuiet operation\nthroughout the entire drawer travel\nFull Extension for Complete Access\nThe KA 4532 provides\n100% full extension\n, meaning you can access the entire drawer depth without obstruction. This is particularly valuable for:\nKitchen cabinets:\nEasy access to items at the back of deep pantry drawers\nOffice furniture:\nComplete visibility of file folders and supplies\nWorkshop storage:\nQuick retrieval of tools and parts from deep drawers\nWardrobe installations:\nFull access to clothing and accessories\nQuick Release Mechanism for Easy Maintenance\nThe integrated\nquick release catch\nallows you to detach the drawer from the cabinet body in seconds—no tools required. Simply pull the drawer to full extension, press the release levers on both sides, and lift the drawer away. This makes cleaning, reorganizing, or servicing your drawers incredibly convenient.\nBuilt for Heavy-Duty Applications\nWith a\n35kg (77 lbs) load capacity\ncertified to European standard\nEN 15338, Level 2\n, the KA 4532 is engineered for demanding applications:\nKitchen pantry drawers:\nHeavy pots, pans, and cookware\nWorkshop tool drawers:\nDense metal tools and equipment\nOffice file drawers:\nMultiple reams of paper and binders\nDeep wire basket installations:\nBulk storage in modular systems\nVersatile Drawer Compatibility\nThe KA 4532 is designed for side mounting and works with:\nWooden drawers\nwith grooved, rebated, or loosely fitted bases\nDeep wire basket systems\n(fixing clamps required - order separately)\nCustom drawer designs\nmeeting standard 12.7mm installation width\nCorrosion-Resistant Finish\nThe\ngalvanized steel construction with blue passivation\n(zinc finish) provides excellent corrosion resistance, making the KA 4532 suitable for humid environments like:\nKitchen cabinets (exposure to steam and moisture)\nBathroom vanities (high humidity areas)\nCoastal regions (salt air exposure)\nCommercial kitchens and food service\nGerman Engineering, Trusted Worldwide\nHettich\nhas been a leader in furniture fittings since 1888. With headquarters in Kirchlengern, Germany, Hettich products are trusted by furniture manufacturers, contractors, and DIY enthusiasts worldwide for their reliability, precision, and innovation. The KA 4532 continues this tradition with cutting-edge Silent System technology and meticulous quality control.\nInstallation Made Easy\nThe KA 4532 features a two-stage mounting process:\nDrawer mounting:\nScrew the narrow runner component to the drawer side panels, ensuring the front edge is flush with the drawer front\nCabinet mounting:\nAttach the wider runner component to the cabinet sides at the specified dimensions\nAssembly:\nSimply slide both runner parts together until you hear an audible click\nAll mounting screws are included. For optimal results, use Hettich's direct fixing screws or self-taping screws as specified in the installation guide.\n10-Year Comprehensive Warranty\nHettich stands behind the KA 4532 with a\n10-year replacement warranty\ncovering:\nFunctional defects in materials or workmanship\nSilent System mechanism failure\nBall bearing wear under normal use conditions\nStructural integrity of runner components\nWarranty terms and conditions apply. Proper installation and usage within specified load capacity required.\nInstallation & Planning Guidelines\nMinimum Cabinet Depth Requirements\nTo ensure proper installation and full extension capability, your cabinet must meet these minimum depth requirements:\nChannel Length\nMinimum Cabinet Depth\nActual Drawer Travel\n300mm (12\")\n304mm (12 1/4\")\n290mm\n350mm (14\")\n354mm (14 1/4\")\n340mm\n400mm (16\")\n404mm (16 1/4\")\n390mm\n450mm (18\")\n454mm (18 1/4\")\n440mm\n500mm (20\")\n504mm (20 1/4\")\n490mm\nInstallation Width (Gap Between Drawer and Cabinet)\nThe KA 4532 requires\n12.7mm clearance on each side\nbetween the drawer side panel and the cabinet inner wall. This is the standard EB 12.7 installation width used across Hettich's telescopic channel range.\nRecommended Screw Fixing Points\nFor maximum load capacity and stability, use all main fixing screw holes provided on the runners. The loading capacity of 35kg assumes proper attachment using:\nHettich direct fixing countersunk screws (6.0mm dia. × 14mm)\nOr Hettich self-taping screws of specified size\nInstalled in cabinet material providing screw pull-out resistance > 1,000 N (per EN 320)\nDrawer Base Panel Compatibility\nThe KA 4532 works with drawers featuring:\nGrooved base panels:\nMost common in traditional drawer construction\nRebated base panels:\nWhere the base sits in a routed channel\nLoosely fitted base panels:\nFlush or floating bases\nWire Basket Installation\nFor deep wire basket applications,\nfixing clamps must be ordered separately\n. The clamps provide secure attachment points between the wire basket frame and the telescopic channel runners.\nHettich KA Series Comparison\nHettich offers multiple telescopic channel series.

Warranty does not cover damage from improper installation, exceeding load capacity, or misuse.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nQ: What's the difference between Hettich KA 4532 German and KA 4732 Indian soft close?\nA:\nThe KA 4532 (German design, Taiwan manufactured) features Hettich's advanced Silent System with superior soft-close dampening and quieter operation. The KA 4732 (India manufactured) has a simpler soft-close mechanism and slightly lower manufacturing tolerances. The KA 4532 is preferred for premium installations where silent operation is critical.\nQ: Which length should I order for my kitchen drawer?\nA:\nMeasure the internal depth of your cabinet (back to front). Order a channel length that is 4-10mm shorter than your cabinet depth. For example, a 404mm deep cabinet requires a 400mm channel. The channel provides full extension equal to its nominal length.\nQ: Can I use KA 4532 for wire basket drawers?\nA:\nYes! The KA 4532 is excellent for deep wire basket installations. However, you'll need to purchase\nfixing clamps separately\nto attach the wire basket frame to the channel runners. These clamps are not included in the standard set.\nQ: What is the gap required between drawer and cabinet for installation?\nA:\nThe KA 4532 requires\n12.7mm clearance on each side\n(25.4mm total). This is the standard EB 12.7 installation width. So if your cabinet opening is 500mm wide, your drawer external width should be 474.6mm (500mm - 25.4mm).\nQ: How much weight can one set of KA 4532 channels hold?\nA:\nEach set (left + right runners) is rated for\n35kg total load\n, which includes the weight of the drawer itself plus contents. This is certified to European standard EN 15338, Level 2. For optimal performance, distribute weight evenly across the drawer.\nQ: Is the soft-close mechanism adjustable?\nA:\nThe Silent System soft-close is pre-calibrated at the factory and does not require adjustment. It's designed to provide consistent, reliable soft-closing action throughout the 10-year warranty period.\nQ: Can I install KA 4532 channels myself, or do I need a professional?\nA:\nDIY installation is possible if you're comfortable with basic woodworking and have proper tools (drill, screwdriver, measuring tape, level). Hettich provides detailed installation instructions. However, for best results—especially in visible applications—professional installation is recommended to ensure perfect alignment and smooth operation.\nQ: What's included in one set?\nA:\nEach set includes: Left channel runner, Right channel runner, Mounting screws, Installation instructions. You receive everything needed to install one drawer (both sides).\nQ: Does HomeRun deliver Hettich channels across all of Bangalore?\nA:\nYes!
